v1.0.0
------
This is the state of the code as discussed in the draft of the methods
paper entitled "ScoreBee: Borrowing concepts from video editing to create
flexible, visual, free behavioural coding software."

Outstanding issues include:
- behaviours and groups are edited by changing the scorebee/templates.py source;
- video playing is handled by an external mplayer process, and while viewing
  playback we do not have accurate time (however we do syncronize on every
  scored event, so the science is still good);
- UI always assumes there is a video imported, and dumps many errors to the
  console when first opened.

We wouldn't normally call this "version 1", but it is good enough for lots of
good science, so we aren't going to hold it back.
