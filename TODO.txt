What do we need for publishing?
--------------------------------

- must run on Windows
- must be a double-click on Windows
- would be nice to have on Linux
- would be nice to have .deb on Linux (Chris should be able to help)

- fix some bugs:
    - zooming

Would be nice...
-----------------

- editable data points
- editable data tracks
- track real time (in ms), instead of frames
- better export options


Bugs
-----

- data points dissapear at different zooming levels
- "layout" isn't run when you first open a file


Random ideas to sort
---------------------

- the icon is a stopwatch, painted like a bee

- can we embed mplayer into the process?
- could we hide the mplayer process?
- can we just use phonon (which comes with Qt?)

- have a python thread sit and listen to the stdout on the mplayer and keep
	grabbing the rough progress from it. will need to read '\r' AND '\n' as
	lines. store on
	.reported_pos and .reported_speed

- multiple groups per track so that there can be more complex exclusions

- event/state tracks. event tracks have current behaviour. state tracks are a
  toggle if you just press/release quickly, or they stop when you release after
  a press/hold. This could be a toggle in the track headers.
  
- ruler should always be drawn with the current zoom level. there is no reason
  to not have a working ruler even with no tracks and no video

- track backgrounds should change where there is data but no video
	ie. dark from 0 to the last bit of data, then lighter upto the end of the
	video, then white.

- remove the ruler mouse events entirely. the main window will catch them no
  problem.

- scroll needs to keep playhead in nearly the same positoin when zooming
- playhead should pull scroll forward
	but what if we are doing something elsewhere?
- events completely dissapear at some zoom levels
- keys to jump to the previous and next events

	h_scrollbar -> time_scrollbar
		its value is always in frames


- make sure to keep everything very MVC.
- only do what is absolutely nessesary

- unsaved changes warning should be a sheet
- unsaved changes warning should be accurate


- need to check if the video file is valid when opening a file too.

- export options
	- start time
	- fps (pull the default from the video)


highlight any tracks with open events that are active so we know that it is when paused

playhead needs to look different when in replace mode

write out standards for how overriding events work in various circumstances
record the creation_date of events
	a list of time/note pairs
		<time>: created
		<time>: extended


- consider using weak refs to save references to the app everywhere
	- or for every event to know the track it is a part of, ect.
	- and every track to know the parent it is a part of

get it into py2app with an icon in the dock


create new tracks

need to deal with referenced videos which no longer exist.



data:
	when stuff occours
	how long stuff occours
	

Required
========

- controller
	- timer should be based off os observed speed not requested speed

- Status window.
	
	Typing numbers should set the current time.
		you keep typing which adds digits to the input buffer, interpreting it
		as the current time mode, and setting it when you are done

- Timeline
	- Would be nice if I idn't have to write raw button code fot the lock/invisible.
	- MAYBE have the lock/invisible in a menu instead of a button.
	- selectable tracks with commands in  a menu for locking and hiding them, etc
	- UNDO/REDO!


Would be nice
=============




BUGS
====

- dragging around the timeline sometimes results in the mp being paused, but the controller thinking it is not.
