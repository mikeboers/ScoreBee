It takes about 25-33 ms to make a round trip to/from mplayer for a property
request.

Use loadfile to load a file. needs an absolute path

-identify feeds us lots of ID_
- get_property ALWAYS returns a ANS_

.get_property(name, timeout=0.1)

store all the ID_s and properties and such


it is a bad file if you get the exit=eof at the start, and it is the only thing
in the data
