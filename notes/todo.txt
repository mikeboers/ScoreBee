General
=======



- make sure to keep everything very MVC.
- only do what is absolutely nessesary

- add a folder of templates that tanya can open from
	they are just documents to open

- unsaved changes warning should be a sheet, and should be accurate


- highlight track headers when creating new events or in an event

need to check if the video file is valid when opening a file too.




highlight the event that is active so we know that it is when paused

playhead needs to look different when in replace mode

write out standards for how overriding events work in various circumstances
record the creation_date of events
	a list of time/note pairs
		<time>: created
		<time>: extended




get it into py2app with an icon in the dock


create new tracks

make a nicer file output format

need to deal with referenced videos which no longer exist.



data:
	when stuff occours
	how long stuff occours
	

Required
========

- controller
	- timer should be based off os observed speed not requested speed

- Status window.
	
	Typing numbers should set the current time.
		you keep typing which adds digits to the input buffer, interpreting it
		as the current time mode, and setting it when you are done

- Timeline
	- Would be nice if I idn't have to write raw button code fot the lock/invisible.
	- MAYBE have the lock/invisible in a menu instead of a button.
	- selectable tracks with commands in  a menu for locking and hiding them, etc
	- UNDO/REDO!


Would be nice
=============




BUGS
====

- dragging around the timeline sometimes results in the mp being paused, but the controller thinking it is not.
