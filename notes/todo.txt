General
=======

- make sure to keep everything very MVC.
- only do what is absolutely nessesary

- add a folder of templates that tanya can open from
	they are just documents to open

- unsaved changes warning should be a sheet, and should be accurate




need to check if the video file is valid when opening a file too.

tracks should be displayed even if there is no video



highlight the event that is active so we know that it is when paused

playhead needs to look different when in replace mode

write out standards for how overriding events work in various circumstances
record the creation_date of events
	a list of time/note pairs
		<time>: created
		<time>: extended


new/open file:
	clean up the tracks that already exist.

open video:
	need to be able to select a video
	need to not have it explode until you select one

get it into py2app with an icon in the dock

option click to delete events

create new tracks

make a nicer file output format

need to deal with referenced videos which no longer exist.

timeline layout needs to have alternate mode for

data:
	when stuff occours
	how long stuff occours
	

Required
========

- controller
	- timer should be based off os observed speed not requested speed

- Status window.
	
	Typing numbers should set the current time.
		you keep typing which adds digits to the input buffer, interpreting it
		as the current time mode, and setting it when you are done

- Data structure:
	- A document object has a filename
	- it has it's own mp object (which it always makes sure is not dead)
	- Each track is it's own object.
		name, key, data
	- Each event on the track is it's own object.
		start frame, end frame
	- Events that are in progress are normal events, just the main controller
	  knows that it has to keep updating them.
	- Need to be able to quickly lookup the next event start time.
	- merge two when they collide

- Timeline
	- Would be nice if I idn't have to write raw button code fot the lock/invisible.
	- MAYBE have the lock/invisible in a menu instead of a button.
	- selectable tracks with commands in  a menu for locking and hiding them, etc
	- zoom commands on cmd-+ and cmd--
	- UNDO/REDO!


Would be nice
=============

- MPlayer property getting more robust with more error checking. .get_fps(...)
	has explicit timeout, and throws and exception if it doesnt work.

BUGS
====

- dragging around the timeline sometimes results in the mp being paused, but the controller thinking it is not.
