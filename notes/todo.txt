General
=======

- make sure to keep everything very MVC.
- only do what is absolutely nessesary


highlight the event that is active so we know that it is when paused

playhead needs to look different when in replace mode

write out standards for how overriding events work in various circumstances
record the creation_date of events
	a list of time/note pairs
		<time>: created
		<time>: extended

warning leaving withou saving
file saving/loading
	cleanup all the tracks and event widgets

get it into py2app with an icon in the dock


Required
========

- controller
	- timer should be based off os observed speed not requested speed

- Status window.
	Current time in frames or a float, basic playing controls. Indicator of
	the current speed.
	
	The time will be free running, and every couple seconds sync up with the
	mplayer time.
	
	Red light if I know that the timer is out of sync.
	
	Typing numbers should set the current time.
		you keep typing which adds digits to the input buffer, interpreting it
		as the current time mode, and setting it when you are done
		

- Info window.
	Has a number of sections that (would be nice) are collapsable. Just key
	value pairs under that.

- Data structure:
	- A document object has a filename
	- it has it's own mp object (which it always makes sure is not dead)
	- Each track is it's own object.
		name, key, data
	- Each event on the track is it's own object.
		start frame, end frame
	- Events that are in progress are normal events, just the main controller
	  knows that it has to keep updating them.
	- Need to be able to quickly lookup the next event start time.
	- merge two when they collide

- Timeline
	- Would be nice if I idn't have to write raw button code fot the lock/invisible.
	- MAYBE have the lock/invisible in a menu instead of a button.
	- selectable tracks with commands in  a menu for locking and hiding them, etc
	- zoom commands on cmd-+ and cmd--
	- UNDO/REDO!


Would be nice
=============

- MPlayer property getting more robust with more error checking. .get_fps(...)
	has explicit timeout, and throws and exception if it doesnt work.

BUGS
====

- dragging around the timeline sometimes results in the mp being paused, but the controller thinking it is not.
